				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="picture.jpg" alt="Picture of Stephen Hayes" class="float-left rounded" />
				<p>I am currently studying full-stack development with <a href="https://www.learningpeople.com/au/" target="_blank">Learning People</a>. I am competent writing HTML 5 and CSS 3, and am able to implement Bootstrap 4 in web projects. I also have some experience using languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Asp.Net, and am currently learning to use Python. I have used frameworks such as jQuery and .Net. Additionally, I have some experience with web hosting and relational databases (SQL Server).</p>
				<p>My professional experience in software development has so far consisted of writing VBA macros for a large organisation to manage significant volumes of emails, and maintaining a database recording feedback of customer service agents. My experience in web development has come primarily through maintaining my <a href="https://www.stephenhayesonline.com/" target="_blank">personal website</a>, through which I promote and sell my novels.</p>
